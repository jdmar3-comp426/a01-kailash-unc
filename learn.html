       <p>There are many ways to learn more about Poseidon. One way that many start is by
           delwing into greek mythology and its archives. A lot can be learned about the origins
           of greek mythology, and thus, better be able to understand who Poseidon was to the 
           greek people. If you would like to take the fun route to learning more, I suggest
           starting with Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & The Olympians series. It is a fictional
           series that introduces Percy, in greek Percious, who is the son Poseidon. As he begins
           as an awkward kid with dyslexia, he soon begins to learn of his orgins, and learn about
           his father being poseidon and the universe of greek mythology.
